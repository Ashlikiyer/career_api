    }
  };

  return (

          </div>
        ))}

          type="text"
          value={question}
          onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === "Enter" && askQuestion(question)}
          placeholder="Ask me about IT careers..."
          disabled={loading}
        />
        <button onClick={() => askQuestion(question)} disabled={loading}>
