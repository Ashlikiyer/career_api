```json
{
  "message": "Assessment completed",

  "score": 92 // <- Your frontend uses this
}
```

**New enhanced data also available (optional to use):**

    {
      "career": "Web Developer",

}

// Response: 400 Bad Request
{

## ⚡ **Frontend Integration Options**

### **Option 1: No Changes (Recommended for Quick Deploy)**

Your existing code works perfectly:

```javascript
// This continues to work exactly as before
const handleAssessmentComplete = (response) => {
  const career = response.career_suggestion; // "Machine Learning Engineer"
  const score = response.score; // 92

  setCareerResult(career);
  setConfidenceScore(score);

  // This will now work without errors!
  saveCareer(career, score);
};
```

**Result:** Users immediately see more specific careers and can save them successfully.

### **Option 2: Enhanced Display (Optional)**

Show additional career information:

```javascript
const handleAssessmentComplete = (response) => {
  // Use enhanced data if available
  if (response.career_suggestions && response.career_suggestions.length > 0) {
    const primaryCareer = response.career_suggestions[0];

    setCareerResult({
      name: primaryCareer.career,
      compatibility: primaryCareer.compatibility,
      reason: primaryCareer.reason,
      additionalOptions: response.career_suggestions.length - 1,
    });
  } else {
    // Fallback to legacy format
    setCareerResult({
      name: response.career_suggestion,
      compatibility: response.score,
      reason: "Based on your assessment responses",
    });
  }
};
```

### **Option 3: Multiple Career Cards (Advanced)**

Display all 5 career suggestions:

```javascript
const handleAssessmentComplete = (response) => {
  if (response.career_suggestions) {
    setCareerSuggestions(response.career_suggestions);
    setShowMultipleCareers(true);
  } else {
    // Handle legacy response
    setCareerSuggestions([
      {
        career: response.career_suggestion,
        compatibility: response.score,
        reason: "Based on your assessment responses",
      },
    ]);
  }
};
```

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Regression Testing (Critical)**

Ensure your existing flow still works:

1. ✅ **User Registration/Login** - Should work identically
2. ✅ **Start Assessment** - Should work identically
3. ✅ **Answer Questions** - Should work identically
4. ✅ **Complete Assessment** - Should show more specific career (e.g., "Web Developer" instead of "Software Engineer")
5. ✅ **Save Career** - Should work without 400 errors (THIS WAS BROKEN BEFORE)
6. ✅ **View Saved Careers** - Should display all saved careers

### **Enhanced Features Testing (Optional)**

If you implement enhanced features:

1. 🔮 **Multiple Career Display** - Show all 5 suggestions
2. 🔮 **Compatibility Scores** - Display percentages and reasons
3. 🔮 **Save Multiple Careers** - Let users save several options
4. 🔮 **Career Comparison** - Side-by-side career analysis

### **Error Handling**

```javascript
// Test these scenarios
const testCases = [
  "Machine Learning Engineer", // Should save successfully now
  "Web Developer", // Should save successfully now
  "UX/UI Designer", // Should save successfully now
  "DevOps Engineer", // Should save successfully now
  "Invalid Career Name", // Should still return 400 error
];
```
