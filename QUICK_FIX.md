# URGENT: Frontend Fix for Assessment ID Issue

## Problem Identified

Your frontend is calling `/api/assessment/start` **TWICE** which creates two different assessments:

1. First call creates assessment ID 11 (stored in session)
2. Second call creates assessment ID 12 (but session still remembers ID 11)
3. When you submit answer with ID 12, it doesn't match session ID 11 → validation fails

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use New Combined Endpoint (RECOMMENDED)

Replace your current assessment flow with this new endpoint:

```javascript
// Instead of calling /status then /start, use this single endpoint
const getOrCreateAssessment = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get("/api/assessment/current");
    return response.data;
    // This will either return existing assessment or create new one
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || error;
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Fix Frontend Logic (Alternative)

If you prefer to keep current endpoints, fix your frontend to prevent double calls:

```javascript
// Add a flag to prevent multiple calls
let isStartingAssessment = false;

const startAssessment = async () => {
  if (isStartingAssessment) {
    console.log("Assessment already starting, skipping...");
    return;
  }

  isStartingAssessment = true;
  try {
    const response = await api.get("/api/assessment/start");
    return response.data;
  } finally {
    isStartingAssessment = false;
  }
};
```

## Immediate Test

1. Deploy the backend changes I just made
2. Use the new `/api/assessment/current` endpoint instead of calling start twice
3. OR fix your frontend to only call start once

## Why This Happens

This is a common React issue where:

- Component re-renders trigger multiple API calls
- Status check → start → another start call
- Each start call creates a new assessment in database

The new `/api/assessment/current` endpoint I created will:

- Check if assessment exists in session
- Return existing assessment if found
- Create new assessment only if needed
- Always return the same assessment ID for the session

Try this and let me know if it fixes the issue!
