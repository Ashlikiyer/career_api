# 🔧 FIXED: Auto-Generated Roadmaps Error

## ❌ **The Problem**

- Frontend was getting 500 error when trying to view roadmaps
- Error: "Failed to fetch roadmap"

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

Database column name mismatch:

- **Database column**: `step_descriptions` (plural)
- **Model/Controller**: `step_description` (singular)

## ✅ **The Fix**

### 1. **Fixed Model** (`models/career_roadmaps.js`)

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
step_description: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING;
}

// AFTER (correct)
step_descriptions: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING;
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Save Career Controller** (`controllers/savedCareerController.js`)

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect field name)
step_description: `${step.title}: ${step.description}`;

// AFTER (correct field name)
step_descriptions: `${step.title}: ${step.description}`;
```

### 3. **Fixed Roadmap Controller** (`controllers/roadmapController.js`)

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect field access)
step_description: dbStep.step_description;

// AFTER (correct field mapping)
step_description: dbStep.step_descriptions; // Map DB field to API field
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

- ✅ **Save Career**: Creates career + auto-generates roadmap (201 response)
- ✅ **Get Roadmap**: Returns roadmap immediately (200 response)
- ✅ **Auto-generation**: `auto_generated: true` for new careers
- ✅ **Fallback**: `auto_generated: false` for older careers (JSON data)

## 🎯 **Status**

**FULLY WORKING!** The auto-generated roadmaps feature is now functioning correctly.

### **For New Careers**:

1. Save career → Roadmap automatically created in database
2. View roadmap → Loads from database (`auto_generated: true`)

### **For Existing Careers**:

1. View roadmap → Falls back to JSON data (`auto_generated: false`)

## 🚀 **Ready for Frontend Integration**

Your frontend can now successfully:

- Save careers (gets enhanced response with `roadmapGenerated: true`)
- View roadmaps immediately (no 500 errors)
- Handle both auto-generated and fallback roadmaps seamlessly

The issue was a simple database field naming mismatch that has been completely resolved! 🎉
