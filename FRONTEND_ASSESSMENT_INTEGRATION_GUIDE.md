  // Should complete all 10 questions without errors
];
```

## 💻 **Frontend Code Updates Needed**

### **Option 1: Minimal Changes (Recommended)**

Update your career name handling to accept the new names:

```javascript
// Career name mapping for display consistency
const careerDisplayNames = {
  "UX/UI Designer": "UX/UI Designer",  // New name
  "QA Tester": "Quality Assurance Tester",  // New name, display as preferred
  "Software Engineer": "Software Engineer",  // Unchanged
  "Data Scientist": "Data Scientist"  // Unchanged
};

const displayCareerName = (backendCareerName) => {
  return careerDisplayNames[backendCareerName] || backendCareerName;
};

// Use in your components
const AssessmentResult = ({ career, confidence }) => {
  return (
    <div className="assessment-result">
      <h3>{displayCareerName(career)}</h3>
      <p>Confidence: {confidence}%</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Option 2: Backward Compatibility (If Needed)**

If your frontend has hardcoded career names, add compatibility mapping:

```javascript
const handleAssessmentResponse = (response) => {
  // Backend now returns updated career names
  let { career, confidence, feedbackMessage, nextQuestionId } = response;
  
  // Optional: Map to legacy names if your UI expects them
  const legacyCareerNames = {
    "UX/UI Designer": "Graphic Designer",  // Only if your UI expects old name
    "QA Tester": "Software Tester/Quality Assurance"  // Only if your UI expects old name
  };
  
  // Use legacy names if your UI isn't updated yet
  const displayCareer = legacyCareerNames[career] || career;
  
  setCurrentCareer(career);  // Store backend name for API calls
  setDisplayCareer(displayCareer);  // Use display name in UI
  setConfidence(confidence);
  
  if (nextQuestionId) {
    loadNextQuestion(nextQuestionId);
  }
};
```

### **Option 3: Enhanced Error Handling (Recommended)**

Add robust error handling for the assessment flow:

```javascript
const submitAnswer = async (assessmentId, questionId, selectedOption) => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    const response = await api.post('/api/assessment/answer', {
      assessment_id: assessmentId,
      question_id: questionId,
      selected_option: selectedOption
    });
    
    // Success - all career paths now work
    const { career, confidence, feedbackMessage, nextQuestionId } = response.data;
    
    setCurrentCareer(career);
    setConfidence(confidence);
    setFeedback(feedbackMessage);
    
    if (nextQuestionId) {
      await loadNextQuestion(questionId, assessmentId);
    } else {
      // Assessment complete
      setAssessmentComplete(true);
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Assessment submission error:', error);
    
    // Enhanced error messaging
    if (error.response?.status === 500) {
      setError('Assessment system error. Please restart the assessment.');
      // Optionally auto-restart
      // restartAssessment();
    } else if (error.response?.status === 400) {
      setError('Invalid response. Please select an option and try again.');
    } else {
      setError('Network error. Please check your connection and try again.');
    }
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

---

## 🎯 **Assessment Completion Flow**

### **Final Assessment Results:**

After 10 questions, your frontend will receive multiple career suggestions:

```javascript
const handleAssessmentComplete = async (assessmentId) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/api/assessment/results/${assessmentId}`);
    const { careerSuggestions } = response.data;
    
    // You'll receive 5 career suggestions from the 16 available careers
    setCareerSuggestions(careerSuggestions);
    
    // Example response structure:
    /*
    careerSuggestions: [
      { career: "UX/UI Designer", confidence: 85 },
      { career: "Frontend Developer", confidence: 78 },
      { career: "Web Developer", confidence: 72 },
      { career: "Game Developer", confidence: 65 },
      { career: "Graphic Designer", confidence: 60 }
    ]
    */
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load assessment results:', error);
    setError('Failed to load career suggestions. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

---

## 🔄 **Career Saving Integration**

### **Updated Career Names for Saving:**

When users save careers, use the **backend career names** (not display names):

```javascript
const saveCareer = async (careerName) => {
  try {
    // Use the exact career name returned by the backend
    const response = await api.post('/api/saved-careers', {
      career_name: careerName  // e.g., "UX/UI Designer", "QA Tester"
    });
    
    const savedCareer = response.data;
    setSavedCareers([...savedCareers, savedCareer]);
    
    // Show success message with display name
    setSuccessMessage(`${displayCareerName(careerName)} saved successfully!`);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save career:', error);
    setError('Failed to save career. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

---

## 🗺️ **Roadmap Generation Integration**

### **All Career Types Now Work:**

```javascript
const generateRoadmap = async (savedCareerId) => {
  try {
    setLoadingRoadmap(true);
    
    const response = await api.get(`/api/roadmaps/${savedCareerId}`);
    const { career_name, roadmap } = response.data;
    
    // All 16 career types now have roadmaps
    setRoadmapData({ career_name, roadmap });
    setRoadmapGenerated(true);
    
    // Success message
    setSuccessMessage(`Generated ${roadmap.length}-step learning path for ${career_name}!`);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Roadmap generation error:', error);
    
    if (error.response?.status === 404) {
      // This should rarely happen now - all careers have roadmaps
      setError('Roadmap not available for this career yet.');
    } else {
      setError('Failed to generate roadmap. Please try again.');
    }
  } finally {
    setLoadingRoadmap(false);
  }
};
```

## 🔄 **Latest Update - Assessment State Management (RESOLVED)**

### **Issue Fixed (Backend Only - No Frontend Changes Required):**
- **Problem:** When users took multiple assessments without clicking "Retake Assessment", final results were contaminated by previous assessment data
- **Symptoms:** 
  - ✅ With "Retake Assessment" button: Accurate results
  - ❌ Without "Retake Assessment" button: Results showed previous career path instead of current answers

### **Resolution Applied (Backend Only):**
- ✅ **Fresh Assessment Creation:** Each new assessment creates completely clean state
- ✅ **Assessment Isolation:** Results based solely on current answers, not previous history
- ✅ **Database State Reset:** No data contamination between assessments

### **Impact on Frontend:**
- **✅ No code changes required** - your existing frontend works perfectly
- **✅ Better user experience** - consistent, accurate results every time
- **✅ Expected behavior restored** - each assessment is independent

### **What This Means:**
Users can now take multiple assessments in sequence without the "Retake Assessment" button and get accurate results based on their current answers, not influenced by previous assessment history.
